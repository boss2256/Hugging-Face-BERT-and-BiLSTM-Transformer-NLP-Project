## Mission
The mission of this project is to leverage state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) techniques to create an advanced text generation and classification system. By combining BERT and BiLSTM with Transformer models, the project aims to push the boundaries of what is possible in NLP applications.

## Motivation
The motivation behind this project is to explore the capabilities of combining different NLP models to improve the accuracy and efficiency of text generation and classification tasks. The project seeks to address complex language processing challenges and provide solutions that can be applied in various domains such as content creation, sentiment analysis, and automated customer support.

## Use Case
The primary use case for this project is to develop an NLP system that can generate coherent and contextually relevant text based on input prompts. This system can be utilized in applications such as automated content generation for blogs, articles, and marketing materials. Additionally, it can be used for sentiment analysis and customer feedback classification in business applications.

## Tech Stack
- **Hugging Face Transformers**: Utilized for pre-trained language models, specifically BERT for its robust text representation capabilities.
- **BiLSTM**: A bidirectional LSTM model that captures dependencies from both directions in the text.
- **PyTorch**: The primary deep learning framework used for building and training the models.
- **Datasets**: Leveraged the Hugging Face datasets library for easy access to text datasets.
- **SentencePiece**: Used for tokenization and text preprocessing.

## How to Run the Project
